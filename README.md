# BBQ Splash Page

This is a practice HTML/CSS Project I made as a part of the Kevin Powell's [**Responsive Design Bootcamp**](https://scrimba.com/learn/responsive).

Live Demo [here](https://bbqsplashpage.netlify.app/)

_It was made using the [Vanilla Playground Template](https://github.com/kr40/vanilla-playground/generate)._

# Vanilla Playground

Vanilla Playground to mess around with HTML/CSS/JS. Scaffolded with `vite`.

Comes with `eslint` and `stylelint`
pre-configured.

**Assumes `prettier` is already configured.**

Also comes with `water.css`, `font-awesome 5` & `normalize.css`.

`water.css` is a no-class `css` framework which just makes things look good out of the box. It comes with a automatic dark/light theme switching based on `prefer-color-scheme` media query, just use -

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/water.css@2/out/water.css">`.

**Note: Remove the existing stylesheet used for `water.css` which I used to make the theme switcher if you wish to use the automatic theme.**

## Usage

`npm install` to install the required node modules.

`npm run dev` to run dev server with live preview.

`npm run serve` to previw the production build.
